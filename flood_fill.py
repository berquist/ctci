n x m rectangle


2 properties:
* C2 symmetric (axis perpendicular to the grid)
* All light squares are up, down, left, right connected

(x,y) -> (-x, -y)


x1, x2, y1 ,y2 ==> x1 + x2 = const. y1 + y2 = const.


n = 3, m = 6
[0, 3] -> [2, 2]
[1, 3] -> [1, 2]
[x, y] -> [n-x, m-y]


[3-0, 6-3] -> [3, 3] (x)
[3-1, 6-3] -> [2, 3]


Transformation for comparison: [x, y] -> [n-x-1, m-y-1]


Your solution:


def check_representation(grid):
        """Take in an [n, m] grid and return a boolean."""
        # 1. check for C2 symmetry
        for i in range(n):
                for j in range(m):
                        if grid[i, j] != grid[n-i-1, m-j-1]:
                                return False
        # 2. check for light square connectivity
        return True

Notes:
Algorithms:
  Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, MST, Dijkstraâ€™s, flood fill)
  Trees (binary search tree), walk tree, search a tree, add something, delete something
  Sorting (merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort)
  Priority queue (heap)
  Hash table/map. Bloom filter.


Write something down. A fine finished solution is better than a partially finished perfect solution.
